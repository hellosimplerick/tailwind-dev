# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Why I build this. well, modifed the basic

Trying to get tailwind 4.0 running was so painful. To finally get this basic working but this is tailwind ver 3 not ver 4

I should point out that app.jsx is your base for the app. I made this to work on just getting a hot-reload environment to get UI/UX done before moving to a 'read' world we all the actual code for loading files, saving, reading AWS (for example), etc.
